FeedSmart is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) model derived from the conceptual PetCaringSystem, designed to demonstrate the real-world feasibility of an automated pet feeding system that integrates mechanical dispensing, sensor monitoring, and wireless communication. Built on an ESP32 microcontroller, FeedSmart validates how core system components—such as the food hopper, dispenser mechanism, and controller—interact with a mobile app and cloud database via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The PoC showcases seamless data flow, remote operation, and system reliability, serving as a foundational step toward developing a fully functional, scalable MVP for intelligent pet care.
