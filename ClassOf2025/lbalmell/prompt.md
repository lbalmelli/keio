# Prompt Log for IdeaWall Modeling

This file documents the key prompts used to construct the conceptual and proof-of-concept models for the IdeaWall system using SysML v2.

## 🧩 Conceptual Model Creation

1. "Let's start a new model and iterate together on a set of ideas that I can use to create an idea wall, which I describe as an electronic whiteboard that will allow me to share ideas with the team and to work on a new product concept based on these ideas. It should be a collaboration device that multiple people can use, even remotely connected, and foster creativity while exchanging concepts around a single product."
2. "Let's agree on a definition for each of them - let's work one by one."
3. "Idea can be also harvested via AI agents and should be marked as when coming from AI or human..."
4. "Can you propose a rating system for ideas?"
5. "I want the value of an idea to be context-dependent, especially using a timestamp..."
6. "I don't want to assess an idea using a single score... I want the score to be a vector of values..."
7. "In order to keep my model very conceptual, I would like to change the display surface to a simple display..."
8. "I like the repository to be intrinsically implemented using a large-language model..."

## 🛠️ Proof-of-Concept Model Creation

9. "I would like to create the first proof-of-concept out of my conceptual model..."
10. "Let's start with a display. Can you propose to me a list of existing displays..."
11. "I would like to do the same thing now and find a series of candidates for inputs..."
12. "Please use the following element in a new, separated, proof-of-concept model..."
13. "Let's review the parts in the proof-of-concept one by one again..."
14. "Can you add a second brain input to the part proof-of-concept system?"
15. "Can you add an attribute called side to the part definition BrainLink_Lite_EEG_Headband..."
16. "I noticed that the element proofOfConceptSystem is not expressed as a definition using Part Def..."
17. "I would like to generate multiple instances of my proofOfConceptSystem..."
18. "Compare the concept model and the proof-of-concept model in a table format."
19. "From the documentation stored in each part, you write one paragraph description of my system..."
20. "Create a table where the first column contains the name of the part..."
