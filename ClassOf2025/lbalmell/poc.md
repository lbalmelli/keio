# Proof-of-Concept Overview

The proof-of-concept (POC) system is a physical instantiation of the conceptual IdeaWall model. It integrates real-world commercial components to prototype essential functionalities such as idea input, collaborative interaction, and early-stage data processing. The goal of this implementation is to validate the interaction of core components and assess how input modalities and system integration support collaborative idea development.

The following table traces the relationships between the components of the conceptual model and their counterparts in the proof-of-concept implementation. It also provides insights into how each conceptual idea has been translated or adapted into a practical form.

| **Conceptual Model Element** | **POC Model Element**                                                                    | **Transformation & Implementation Insight**                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `display: Display`           | `TouchWo_Interactive_Smartboard`                                                         | The abstract display concept was realized using a commercial smartboard that integrates both display and touch input features.                                                    |
| `input: InputInterface`      | `Wacom_MovinkPad_11`, `ReSpeaker_USB_Mic_Array_v2_1`, `BrainLink_Lite_EEG_Headband` (×2) | Conceptual multi-modal input was concretely split into pen-based, voice, and brainwave interfaces to represent different modes of capturing ideas.                                |
| `repository: IdeaRepository` | `MCP_Server`                                                                             | The abstract repository was partially implemented through a custom MCP server that provides agent-facing and API access to a hosted NoSQL database. Full backend not yet modeled. |
| `IdeaWall`                   | `proofOfConceptSystem`                                                                   | The main system concept is represented as a structured part in the POC model, aggregating all selected commercial components without interconnection modeling yet.                |
