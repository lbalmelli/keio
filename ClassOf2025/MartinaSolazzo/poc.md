## Proof-of-Concept (POC) – Landfill Solar System Model

This proof-of-concept validates that the landfill solar configuration (layoutB) derived from the conceptual system model can be implemented in real conditions. It demonstrates feasibility under cost constraints (€500K cap), non-invasive landfill requirements (no ground penetration), regulatory compliance, and stakeholder acceptance. The POC was created to confirm that the conceptual model can be executed in practice, ensuring that abstract architecture elements are traceable to real implementation elements and that they produce measurable operational value.

---

| Conceptual Model Element | POC Model Element | Transformation & Implementation Insight |
|---|---|---|
| SolarPVArray | Ballasted solar panel rows | Ballast replaces anchoring to prevent cap penetration while maintaining structural stability |
| Inverter | Centralized inverter unit | Selected to reduce cabling complexity and lower overall system CAPEX for <300 kW scale |
| MonitoringSystem | Predictive monitoring dashboard | Cloud-based alerts enable remote O&M and reduce on-site inspection needs |
| Dashboard | Tablet visualization interface | Alessandro accesses performance data directly on a mobile device |
| LayoutOption (layoutB) | 250 kW raised mounting design | Chosen to allow limited community access and potential grazing zones while meeting €498K cost scenario |
| Requirements | BudgetConstraint / NonInvasiveDesign / IncentiveEligibility | Requirement constraints executed through verification checks and used as acceptance gates |
| Stakeholders | Alessandro, Chiara, Fabio, ARPA, Laura | Same actors in implementation-review sign-off as in conceptual definition |
| ProofOfConcept | Integrated validation session | Confirms concept → implementation transformation with full cross-stakeholder validation |
