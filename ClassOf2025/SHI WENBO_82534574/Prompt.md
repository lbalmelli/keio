## 1. Concept Model Prompt

##### 1.1 Create a SysML v2 model for a **Green Resilience Station System**. Define the system’s purpose as **“a disaster-resistant solar billboard network that integrates renewable energy generation, emergency communication functions, and ESG-oriented advertising capabilities.”**

##### 1.2 This model was too complex, so help me remove some unnecessary parts.

##### 1.3 Keep the number of major components to 6 or fewer.

##### 1.4 Let's add a verification module to verify our functionality.

##### 1.5 What we need to complete is Minimal Viable Model (MVMs), so you should remove some unnecessary components and functions

##### 1.6 Let's retain the following four parts: requirement, structure, behavior, and verification.

##### 1.7 Now we should delete some unnecessary components in the structure section, such as the solar battery. We already have a battery component, so this part is no longer needed

##### 1.8 Continue to delete the repeated parts according to the above requirements

##### 1.9 Now, let's focus on the behavior section and explore how to construct it to meet the requirements

##### 1.10 Let's try using two different models in the behavior section, such as a regular model and an emergency model

##### 1.11 Now let's try to use a state machine to complete the construction of this part

##### 1.12 It looks good. Do you have any other suggestions

##### 1.13 In the requirement section, please add "Emergency Power Availability" to ensure that power supply can be maintained for more than six hours

##### 1.14 Now, when reconstructing verification, what kind of test cases do we need to achieve our testing goals

##### 2. Proof of Concept (POC) Model Prompt
### 2.1 After mastering the basic concepts, we need to develop a new POC model. Do you have any suggestions？

##### 2.2 The basic framework of the concept model is already in place, so we don't need to create a completely new model. Please tell me how we can improve it

##### 2.3 If we do this, will our model still be traceable?

##### 2.4 Now let's try to consider the structure part. 

##### 2.5 Different from the concept, we need to consider how to build this billboard station in the real environment

##### 2.6 Give me some examples of products currently available on the market

##### 2.7 Try to reconstruct the structure based on the following products

##### 2.8 Not specific enough. Now we will create a parent level for the structure section, which will contain other components

##### 2.9 Based on the changes we have made, do you have any recommendations for the POC part

##### 2.10 Create power ports and data ports, and we attempt to connect these various components

##### 2.11 Now, new verification elements have been added to provide quantitative validation.

##### 2.12 Now let's confirm once again if there are any errors in our energy flow

##### 2.13 Based on the above process, do you have any suggestions for improvement
