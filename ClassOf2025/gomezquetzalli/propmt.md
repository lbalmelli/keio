(1) Problem Statement

Customer / Actor:
Automotive OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), especially teams responsible for lightweighting and sustainability in high-performance sports cars.

What (Problem):
They struggle to reduce the weight and aerodynamic drag of vehicle body components without compromising recyclability, cost, or manufacturability.

Why (Need):
Reducing vehicle weight improves performance and fuel efficiency (or EV range), while better aerodynamics enhance speed and stability. At the same time, increasing pressure from regulations and customers demands greater material sustainability and circularity.

Where/When (Context):
This challenge emerges during the conceptual design and early engineering phases, especially in projects involving new vehicle platforms or compliance with upcoming sustainability standards.

Abstract Problem Statement:

High-performance automotive manufacturers need to integrate lightweight, formable, and recyclable materials into their vehicle architectures to enhance performance and sustainability—without constraining manufacturing or cost feasibility.

(2) Usage / Service Scenarios

Scenario 1: Material Evaluation in Design Phase

Who: Materials Engineer + Sustainability Lead

Where/When: Early-stage materials selection for a new sports car line

Steps:

Engineer reviews material properties for strength-to-weight ratio.

Simulates body panel shape using the new material.

Sustainability Lead verifies recycled content meets internal targets.

Functional: Ensure the material meets strength, formability, and recyclability requirements.

Emotional: Pride in pushing eco-innovation without compromising performance.

Social: Gain buy-in from cross-functional teams by showing lifecycle benefits.

Scenario 2: Prototype Testing and PoC Validation

Who: Systems Engineer + Mechanical Team

Where/When: During bench and wind tunnel testing

Steps:

Integrate composite panels into the prototype frame.

Monitor heat, vibration, and panel deflection under test conditions.

Compare weight reduction vs. baseline material.

Functional: Confirm the composite integrates safely and withstands real conditions.

Emotional: Relief from validating early assumptions.

Social: Demonstrate technical leadership and sustainability commitment.

(3) Customer Struggles & Insights

Persona: Lightweighting Engineer at a sports car OEM
Routine / Obstacles:

Constant pressure to shave off kg without compromising safety.

Traditional carbon fiber is great but expensive and hard to recycle.

Recycled plastics are sustainable but lack mechanical strength or processability.

Unmet Needs / Innovation Signals:

Need for a hybrid material combining sustainability + strength.

Demand for process-compatible materials that fit existing manufacturing lines.

Interest in traceable recycled content for regulatory reporting.

Key Insight Statements:

“Designers want performance and sustainability in the same material, not a trade-off.”

“If the composite can be shaped like traditional body parts and recycled at end-of-life, we can close the loop.”

“Recyclability metrics are becoming as important as weight or stiffness.”
