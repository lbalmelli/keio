🏁 Goal of the Concept

To design and validate a hybrid material composed of carbon fiber reinforcement and recycled PET matrix that reduces weight, enhances aerodynamic formability, and meets recyclability goals for next-generation sports car body panels, all while being compatible with electrical and mechanical vehicle systems.

🔍 Approach to Concept Creation

Cross-domain collaboration between materials, mechanical, electrical, and sustainability teams.

Use of a digital PoC system model to define parts, interfaces, requirements, and behaviors.

Embedding the composite material into an enclosure or panel within a full vehicle system model.

Simulating use cases, traceability to requirements, and stakeholder feedback loops through workflows.

Supporting remote collaboration using an electronic Idea Wall for ideation and review.

🛠️ Draft Plan for Implementation

Week 1–2: Define system concept, actors, and main components in SysML v2

Week 3: Develop material layering (matrix + reinforcement) and relate it to mechanical integration

Week 4–5: Add interfaces, workflows, and requirement traceability in PoC

Week 6: Review integration challenges with stakeholders using the Idea Wall

Week 7: Export diagrams and validate system coherence; prepare physical PoC

Ongoing: Capture improvement points and update model collaboratively
