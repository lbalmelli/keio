# Conceptual Model Documentation: Indoor Solar Energy System for Greenhouses

## Goal of the Concept

The goal of this concept is to design a **cost-effective, modular solar energy system** specifically optimized for **indoor use in greenhouses**. The system aims to supply sustainable and off-grid electricity to support critical agricultural operations such as environmental monitoring, ventilation, and irrigation.

## Approach to the Concept Creation

- **User-Centered Design**: The model is based on a deep understanding of the daily routines and struggles of greenhouse farmers, particularly those in semi-rural areas.
- **Indoor-Specific Optimization**: Recognizing that the system will be used indoors, we intentionally avoided ruggedized, weather-resistant designs. This enables cost reduction and simplifies technical constraints, particularly for the battery system.
- **Spatial Efficiency**: The solar panel subsystem adopts a 3D arrangement resembling plant leaves, allowing each panel to be independently positioned for optimal sunlight exposure.
- **Model-Based Systems Engineering**: Using SysML, the system architecture and behavior were clearly defined, documented, and verified, enabling traceability and modular refinement.

| **Power Converter Subsystem**     | Converts and regulates electrical output to match equipment needs.          |
| **Control Unit Subsystem**        | Manages power distribution, solar tracking, and overall system coordination. |
| **User Interface Subsystem**      | Allows farmers to monitor system status and make adjustments.               |
| **Electricity Supply Interface**  | Interfaces with greenhouse equipment (fans, sensors, pumps).                |
| **Panel Position Controller**     | Adjusts solar panel positions in real-time to maximize sunlight absorption. |
