## Modeling Trace – Translation Glass System

This file logs the key prompts and design inquiries used in the creation of the conceptual and proof-of-concept models for the Translation Glass system. It serves as a transparent record of the reasoning and decisions made throughout the development process.

---

### 1. Problem Understanding

**Prompt:**  
“Please help me write a problem statement. The statement should clearly identify:
- Who the customer is
- What the problem or struggle is
- Why the customer needs to solve it
- Where and When the problem occurs, to give context
The statement must be abstract enough so that the solution space is not constrained.”

**Intent:**  
To frame a high-level, innovation-enabling problem statement for multilingual users facing real-time language barriers.

---

### 2. Scenario Development

**Prompt:**  
“Based on a given problem statement, generate a set of scenarios showing how a customer would use or engage with a solution to make progress. Include:
- Context (who, where, when)
- Sequence of steps the customer takes
- Functional, emotional, and social dimensions”

**Intent:**  
To explore diverse user contexts and derive potential product features through use scenarios.

---

### 3. Customer Struggles and Insights

**Prompt:**  
“Help me identify customer struggles and extract insights. For a target user:
- Describe their routine and the obstacles they face
- Explain how those translate into unmet needs
- Propose key insight statements that capture deeper needs”

**Intent:**  
To synthesize user pain points into actionable insights that could inform requirement modeling.

### 4. SysML v2 Conceptual Model

**Prompt:**  
“Create SysML v2 model for the problem statement you gave me above.”

**Intent:**  
To model the problem and user needs using abstract elements and requirement structures in SysML v2.

---

### 5. System Feature Integration

**Prompt:**  
“I need this system to have requirements of turn on and off switch, language setup menu, transparent glass.”

**Intent:**  
To extend the model with specific product-level system requirements.

---

### 6. Documentation File Creation

**Prompt:**  
“Create a file model.md that explains the purpose of the model under the following structure:
- Goal of the concept
- Approach to the concept creation
- List of the main components
- Draft plan for implementation
Include a Markdown command to display a local image.”

**Intent:**  
To create project documentation that communicates the model clearly for readers or reviewers.

---

### 7. Visual Representation Support

**Prompt:**  
“I need an image of this concept model with subtitles.”

**Intent:**  
To gather supporting visuals showing real-time translation via augmented reality glasses.

This trace illustrates a thoughtful progression from abstract need identification to actionable modeling decisions and documented system requirements.
