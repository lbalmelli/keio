# Cursor rules (local to student project)
- Always read `.keio/methodology.md` before generating artifacts.
- Offer the most relevant prompt from `.keio/prompts/` for the current task.
- Enforce trace IDs: CON-###, POC-###, ANL-###, DSN-###.
- Place files under: concepts/, pocs/, analysis/, designs/ accordingly.
- Each artifact README must include: purpose, assumptions, acceptance criteria, links.

When generating **SysML v2**:
- Cross-check against `.keio/cheatsheets/sysml-v2-cheatsheets.md`.
- If uncertain, provide preferred + alternate syntax with a short note.
