# SysML Product Models for Concept Development: Keio University Course Projects

![Keio University Logo](Keio.png)

This repository stores SysML-based product models developed using GPT-powered ideation and modeling guidance, specifically tailored for concept design and proof of concept (PoC) development. Each model showcases a systematic approach to creating structured, realistic representations of innovative products, utilizing SysML for precise requirement management, system architecture, and behavioral modeling. These models were created as part of a course I teach on model-based product development at Keio University in Tokyo, guiding students through practical applications of SysML and AI-driven concept exploration.
