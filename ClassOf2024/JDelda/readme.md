# Block-Based Programming Learning Tool Proof of Concept (PoC)

The **Block-Based Programming Learning Tool** model focuses on building an educational tool where students can learn programming concepts through a visual interface of drag-and-drop blocks. By allowing users to create, save, and execute code within a structured workspace, the model promotes hands-on learning in programming without requiring extensive prior knowledge of syntax. The toolâ€™s design is organized into several key interface components that mirror common elements in coding environments: a `BlockWorkspace` for arranging code blocks, a `ControlPanel` to run or stop programs, and a `FeedbackPanel` and `Console` for real-time output and debugging. These features, combined with support options like a `HelpPanel` and adjustable settings in the `SettingsPanel`, make the tool a self-contained environment where students can iteratively test their code and receive feedback, ultimately enhancing their understanding of programming logic. Market-ready hardware options, such as a Raspberry Pi or Intel NUC for processing, and touchscreen displays, like the Waveshare or Dell monitors, make the tool adaptable for various educational setups, from individual learning to classroom use.

In creating this Proof of Concept (PoC), the approach focused on modularity and real-world applicability. Key parts in the model represent each interface element or hardware component as a distinct module with defined behaviors, enabling easy customization and future scalability. For instance, states are defined for typical workflows like file operations and program execution, allowing the tool to transition smoothly between actions such as saving/loading projects or running/stopping code. To improve usability and ensure reliable feedback, the model integrates specific actions with real-time status indicators for student interactions, such as the success of a file save action or live console output for running programs. By including commercially available components, like Logitech K400 for keyboard navigation or Adafruit Circuit Playground Express for sensor-based interaction, the model supports a diverse set of use cases that align with practical educational needs. The result is a comprehensive and adaptable framework that addresses both software and hardware aspects, providing educators and developers with a robust foundation for implementing an interactive, block-based programming learning tool.
