# Environmental Control Reptile Cage - Proof of Concept

## Product Concept and Use Cases

The concept behind the *Environmental Control Reptile Cage* is to provide a fully automated, controlled habitat that maintains optimal conditions for reptiles within an enclosure. This model addresses the needs of reptiles in captivity, where stable environmental factors are essential for their health and well-being. Many reptiles require specific temperature and humidity levels to thrive, as their physiological functions, like digestion and immune response, are closely tied to these conditions. This controlled cage environment aims to mimic natural conditions closely, ensuring that the reptile is comfortable, healthy, and free from stress. This solution is useful for herpetologists, reptile breeders, and enthusiasts who want to ensure a high standard of care for their animals while reducing the amount of manual intervention.

In practice, the *Environmental Control Reptile Cage* is valuable across multiple use cases, including zoological research, educational facilities, and pet stores where various reptile species may require different, precise environmental conditions. For breeders and hobbyists managing multiple enclosures with different species, such a system can alleviate the need for constant manual adjustments, allowing them to automate and monitor environmental factors unique to each species. This solution also has applications in reptile recovery or quarantine facilities, where controlled environments prevent health complications. By offering a system that adapts to external fluctuations, the *Environmental Control Reptile Cage* demonstrates a new standard in reptile care, emphasizing ease of use and adherence to high animal welfare standards.

## Approach to Creating the Proof of Concept

To develop the Proof of Concept (PoC) model for this product, I focused on integrating necessary hardware and environmental components within a cohesive simulated framework. Starting with the central *ReptileCage*, I based the physical structure on the Exo Terra Glass Terrarium 3090, known for its durability and suitability for a controlled environment. In the PoC model, the *ReptileCage* incorporates a *ConditionedAirPort* for regulated air exchange with *InternalAir*, setting it apart from *ExternalAir*, which introduces ambient environmental factors like temperature and humidity into the system. This distinction helps simulate the influence of both external and internal conditions on the habitat.

A single Arduino-based control system was chosen to manage both temperature and humidity adjustments, relying on DHT22 sensor feedback for real-time data. Essential components like the *GEX_ExoTerraHeatingTop* for heating, a *PeltierCoolingUnit* with a fan for cooling, and *ZensuiFog* and *GexFan* for humidity control were included to meet specific reptile care needs. Additionally, I incorporated an external *PowerSupply* to simulate real-world power requirements, creating a model that is both realistic and scalable. By structuring each component within the SysML v2 framework, this PoC illustrates how each part interacts within the enclosure environment, highlighting the interactions between controlled internal conditions and external ambient factors. This approach allowed me to explore how real-time feedback could be implemented for effective, hands-free reptile care.

## Two-Paragraph Model Explanation

The *Environmental Control Reptile Cage* model represents an advanced automated system designed to maintain optimal conditions within a reptile enclosure. Developed within a SysML v2 framework, this model emphasizes the interaction between the controlled internal environment and the surrounding external conditions. At its core, the *ReptileCage* integrates various components to measure and adjust temperature and humidity through an Arduino-based control system. The model's *ConditionedAirPort* facilitates the exchange of regulated air between the cage and its internal air, while the *ExternalAir* component introduces natural fluctuations in ambient conditions, affecting internal temperature and humidity. With the integration of heating, cooling, humidifying, and dehumidifying components, the model can respond dynamically to environmental changes, ensuring a stable habitat tailored to the needs of captive reptiles.

By combining practical hardware elements such as DHT22 sensors, heating tops, cooling units, and fans, this Proof of Concept demonstrates a realistic approach to creating a self-sustaining reptile habitat. The model is flexible enough to be scaled or modified to accommodate different environmental needs, making it versatile for both professional and personal reptile care applications. Additionally, the SysML v2 framework allows for clear visualization and interaction between components, highlighting the autonomous functionality of the system. This model not only illustrates the technical feasibility of a fully automated reptile care system but also aligns with modern animal welfare standards, demonstrating how controlled, hands-free solutions can enhance reptile health and reduce the need for manual intervention.
