# Collaborative Project Simulation Card Game

This **Collaborative Project Simulation Card Game** is designed to mimic real-world project management and decision-making scenarios encountered by professionals such as engineers, architects, project managers, and cost consultants. The game simulates the dynamics of team collaboration, where each player assumes a specific professional role with unique skills such as negotiation, project management, cost control, and vision. The main objective of the game is to collaboratively construct a "toy house" using materials like wood, plastic, and glass, along with tools like glue, rope, and pins, all while adhering to budget and timeline constraints. The roles and tasks are specifically crafted to encourage strategic communication, negotiation, and decision-making, reflecting the realities of multidisciplinary teamwork.

In this game, each role is represented by a set of specific SysML v2 parts and attributes, such as `negotiationSkill`, `projectSkill`, `visionSkill`, and `costControlSkill`, enabling a structured and modular approach to defining and testing the interactions between team members. The proof of concept model is built around a constrained project scenario with requirements on cost and time, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and resource allocation. This SysML v2 model demonstrates the value of using systems modeling to create a structured simulation for training and team-building, allowing participants to experience the nuances of collaborative project management in a gamified setting.
