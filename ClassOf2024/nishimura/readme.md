# Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) System Model

The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system model represents a high-level conceptual framework for an ACC system designed to autonomously manage a vehicle’s speed to maintain a safe following distance from other vehicles. The primary use cases center around the system's operational states: “Off,” “Active,” and “Maintaining Distance,” with supporting actions that facilitate dynamic responses based on traffic conditions. In the “Off” state, the ACC system is inactive until it receives an “ACC On Signal,” at which point it enters the “Active” state. When activated, the system continuously monitors the distance to the lead vehicle via sensor inputs, specifically the SensorSystem component, which measures both the vehicle’s current speed and the distance to the lead vehicle. If the measured distance is less than a predefined safe threshold, the system transitions to the “Maintaining Distance” state. In this state, the ACC adjusts the throttle or applies the brakes through ThrottleSystem and BrakingSystem components, dynamically increasing or decreasing speed to keep a safe following distance. The system will deactivate and return to the “Off” state if the “ACC Off Signal” is triggered by the user.

In creating the proof of concept for this ACC model, the approach centered on encapsulating the ACC's behavior and interactions through a modular SysML v2 design. Key components like the ACCController, SensorSystem, ThrottleSystem, and BrakingSystem were designed as distinct parts, each with specified ports and actions that model data flows and control signals among them. The ACC states and transitions are modeled in a way that reflects real-world ACC behavior under various conditions, with actions such as “adjust speed,” “apply brakes,” and “detect distance” linking the components functionally. Connections between components are established through interfaces, ensuring that each part communicates effectively to achieve the intended functionality. This model acts as a conceptual baseline for future extensions, such as adding additional states for emergency braking or integrating vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems to improve ACC performance. The proof of concept thus provides a scalable framework that can be expanded to support more complex control algorithms and interactions in a real-world adaptive cruise control system.
