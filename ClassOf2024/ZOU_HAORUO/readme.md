| **Community Engagement**       | Users can connect with others on similar health journeys, sharing experiences and motivating each other.            |

These use cases illustrate the versatile applications of the Smart Health Bracelet, emphasizing its role in enhancing individual health management through technology.

## Approach to Creating the Proof of Concept

To develop a robust proof of concept for the Smart Health Bracelet, a systematic and organized approach was adopted. The following steps outline the key stages of the process:

1. **Defining Core Functionalities**  
   Establishing the essential functions of the bracelet was the first step. These include continuous health monitoring, alert systems, data analysis, and user guidance.

2. **Mapping Real-World Devices**  
   Each component of the bracelet was mapped to existing real-world devices, ensuring practicality and reliability. The integration of recognized brands, such as MorePro and Withings, facilitated a focus on functional performance rather than device development.

3. **Creating a Traceability Table**  
   A comprehensive traceability table was developed to connect SysML elements with specific device functionalities. This table serves as a reference point to understand the contributions of each component:

   | **SysML Element**           | **Mapped Real-World Device**          | **Functionality**                              |
