# AI-Driven Product Development: Keio University Class of 2024

In 2024, Keio Universityâ€™s graduate class in AI-driven product development concept methods embarked on a pioneering journey in model-based product design. 

For the first time, students integrated AI-driven ideation and concept exploration directly into product modeling. Using the SysON SysML IDE and the SySIDE plugin for Visual Studio Code, they explored innovative approaches to concept development within a fully online setup. 

All tools were deployed and managed through the Strong Network Cloud Development Environment platform, allowing seamless access and collaboration. This setup enabled students to gain practical experience in building systematic, AI-enhanced product models, preparing them for the forefront of AI-integrated product development.
