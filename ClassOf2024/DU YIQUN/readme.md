Wheelchair with Baby Seat

Overview

The Wheelchair with Baby Seat is a specially designed mobility solution for parents or caregivers who use a wheelchair and need a safe and comfortable way to transport their baby. This project aims to provide an integrated, ergonomic, and secure seating arrangement for infants while ensuring ease of use for the wheelchair user.

SysML v2 Model Overview

This project follows a SysML v2 model-based approach to system design, ensuring structured representation and analysis of the wheelchair with a baby seat. The model includes:

Requirement Diagrams: Defining key user and system requirements.

Block Definition Diagrams (BDD): Representing system components and their relationships.

Internal Block Diagrams (IBD): Illustrating internal structures and connections.

Parametric Diagrams: Modeling performance constraints and evaluations.

State Machine Diagrams: Capturing different operational states of the system.

By using SysML v2, the project ensures better traceability, maintainability, and adaptability for future improvements.

Features

Secure Baby Seat: A built-in baby seat with a safety harness to keep the baby protected.

Adjustable Positioning: The baby seat can be adjusted to suit different user preferences and wheelchair designs.

Detachable Design: Allows easy removal when not needed.

Lightweight and Sturdy: Made from durable yet lightweight materials for ease of movement.

Installation

Attach the Mounting Frame: Secure the provided mounting frame onto the wheelchair using the included clamps or screws.

Position the Baby Seat: Adjust the seat to the desired position and lock it in place.

Secure the Baby: Use the provided safety harness to fasten the baby securely in the seat.

Test for Stability: Before use, ensure that all components are properly installed and the wheelchair remains balanced.

How to Use

Prepare the Wheelchair: Ensure the wheelchair is stable and on a flat surface.

Secure the Baby Seat: Check that the seat is firmly attached and properly adjusted.

Fasten the Baby: Use the harness to secure the baby safely.

Start Moving: Gently push the wheelchair, maintaining a steady speed.

Monitor Safety: Regularly check the seat's stability and ensure the baby remains comfortable.

Stop and Adjust: If needed, adjust the baby seat or wheelchair settings for better comfort and safety.

Usage Guidelines

Always ensure the baby is securely fastened in the seat before moving.

Do not overload the wheelchair beyond its weight capacity.

Regularly check the mounting frame and seat for any signs of wear or damage.

Avoid rough terrain to prevent excessive shaking or instability.

Never leave the baby unattended in the seat.

Maintenance

Regular Cleaning: Wipe down the baby seat and harness with a damp cloth.

Check Fasteners: Inspect bolts, screws, and clamps for tightness.

Inspect for Wear: Replace any worn-out or damaged parts promptly.

Safety Considerations

Ensure the wheelchair is equipped with a braking system before securing the baby seat.

Use only manufacturer-approved accessories and replacement parts.

Consult with a mobility expert if unsure about compatibility with your wheelchair model.

Future Enhancements

Foldable Baby Seat: For easier storage when not in use.

Adjustable Canopy: To provide sun and weather protection.

Additional Padding: For increased comfort for both the baby and the caregiver.
