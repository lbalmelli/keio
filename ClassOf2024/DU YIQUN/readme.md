## Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Approach
To validate the feasibility of the **Wheelchair with Baby Seat**, we follow a structured PoC approach:
1. **Conceptual Design & 3D Modeling**  
   - Develop CAD models for the wheelchair and baby seat attachment.
2. **Prototype Development**  
   - Build an initial prototype using lightweight materials.
3. **Safety & Load Testing**  
   - Evaluate weight distribution and stress points.
4. **User Testing & Feedback**  
   - Conduct trials with wheelchair users and caregivers.
5. **Iterative Improvements**  
   - Incorporate feedback to refine the design and enhance usability.

## Safety Guidelines
- Always ensure that the **baby seat is properly locked** before use.
- Never leave the baby unattended in the wheelchair seat.
- Regularly check **straps, locks, and brakes** for wear and tear.
- Do not exceed the recommended **weight limit** for the baby seat.

## Future Enhancements
- **Electric Assist Version** for easier maneuverability.
