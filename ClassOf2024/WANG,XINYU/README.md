# Traffic Flow Prediction System PoC Model

This repository contains a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) SysML v2 model for a **Traffic Flow Prediction System**. The system uses a simplified hybrid neural network model to predict traffic flow by processing various inputs related to traffic density and conditions. This PoC model demonstrates the core functionality and structure of the prediction system with key components and connections.

## Model Overview

The **Traffic Flow Prediction System** PoC model is designed to validate the system's ability to predict traffic flow using essential parts and interactions. The model leverages neural network techniques to analyze traffic data and produce flow predictions under basic traffic conditions.

### Key Components

The main components in this model are:
- **NeuralNetwork_PoC**: A core neural network model component for traffic flow predictions.
- **TrafficDataSource_PoC**: Simplified traffic data source providing essential data inputs.
- **TrafficConditionAnalyzer_PoC**: Basic analyzer for preprocessing and normalizing traffic data.
- **PredictionSystem_PoC**: Integrates data source, analyzer, and neural network to produce predictions.

## Model Structure

The model consists of the following packages, parts, actions, and connections. Each component plays a specific role in processing and predicting traffic flow:
