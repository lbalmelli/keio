# Traffic Flow Prediction System

This repository contains a SysML v2 model for a **Traffic Flow Prediction System** designed to predict traffic flow patterns under varying conditions using a hybrid neural network approach. The system is structured to handle inputs from multiple data sources, such as traffic density, road capacity, and weather conditions, allowing it to provide data-driven insights that support more efficient traffic management. The repository includes both a comprehensive model and a streamlined Proof-of-Concept (PoC) model, each developed for distinct purposes in the model development and validation process.

## Use Cases

The **Traffic Flow Prediction System** supports a range of practical use cases across urban planning, traffic management, and autonomous vehicle navigation. For urban planners and city infrastructure managers, the system enables the analysis of long-term traffic patterns, helping to forecast congestion trends and identify areas where infrastructure improvements could reduce bottlenecks. This predictive capability could be particularly valuable in fast-growing urban areas where traffic patterns evolve rapidly. By simulating various traffic conditions, such as peak hour congestion or the impact of weather on traffic flow, the model assists decision-makers in proactively addressing infrastructure needs before issues escalate.

In the realm of real-time traffic management, the system can provide predictions that allow traffic controllers to adjust traffic signals dynamically or manage lane allocations based on predicted congestion levels. For example, by forecasting traffic surges due to weather changes or scheduled events, traffic managers could redirect flows to less congested routes, improving the overall efficiency of the traffic network. This predictive functionality is also beneficial for applications in autonomous vehicle routing, where the model could inform route optimization by identifying the least congested pathways and predicting potential delays, ultimately contributing to safer and more efficient autonomous navigation.

The model’s modular design means it can be adapted for various scales, from city-wide traffic management systems to localized applications, such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) within urban districts. Its ability to integrate data from various sources makes it versatile and expandable, allowing users to incorporate additional factors, such as public transportation schedules or accident reports, for more comprehensive traffic flow analysis. This adaptability supports a wide array of stakeholders in enhancing road safety, reducing travel time, and lowering emissions by minimizing idle times caused by traffic congestion.

## Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Approach

The **PoC Model** included in this repository is a simplified version of the Traffic Flow Prediction System, designed specifically to validate the feasibility of key system components and their interactions before implementing the full model. By isolating and testing the core elements of the traffic prediction system, the PoC model serves as an initial prototype to ensure that fundamental processes, such as data integration, analysis, and flow prediction, function as expected. In this PoC model, the neural network structure is simplified, focusing on basic components like the input data sources and a single data analysis component. This streamlined version allows for faster testing cycles, enabling developers to validate core functions without the complexity of additional neural network layers or intricate data processing logic.

The PoC approach allows for targeted testing of essential system functionalities, such as how the neural network processes traffic data and produces flow predictions. For instance, by providing sample traffic density and weather data, developers can confirm that the system correctly analyzes this data, identifies patterns, and generates a preliminary predictive output. If these basic predictions align with expectations, the PoC model serves as a foundational testbed for more complex feature integration. Additionally, by confirming data flows between data sources and neural network components, the PoC model mitigates potential integration risks early in the development lifecycle.

This method provides significant advantages for iterative development, as it allows stakeholders to review and verify critical model functions at an early stage. Once validated, the PoC model serves as a reliable foundation for expanding the system’s capabilities in the full model, where additional layers, attributes, and interactions can be implemented with greater confidence in the system’s foundational robustness. This iterative PoC-to-full-model approach not only reduces development risk but also improves the accuracy and reliability of the Traffic Flow Prediction System in real-world applications.
