The Sea't-Shell model represents an innovative approach to stabilizing seating in marine environments, designed to provide comfort and mitigate sea-sickness through real-time stabilization technology. The main use cases for the Sea't-Shell include providing a stable seating experience on boats and ships, especially in rough waters, and supporting the physical well-being of users by reducing the disorienting effects of wave motion. This chair concept serves various potential users, including passengers and crew who require prolonged seated stability, researchers conducting experiments at sea, and individuals susceptible to sea-sickness who benefit from balanced seating. 

To develop the Sea't-Shell model, I applied a structured, modular approach using SysML to create a system that integrates marine stabilization technology with user comfort in mind. Starting with a conceptual framework, I outlined the primary system requirements, such as motion detection, real-time adjustment, and user stability. From there, I refined each component's role to build a cohesive, adaptable structure, gradually replacing general system elements with specific technologies suited for marine environments. SysML allowed for organized modeling, where each part represents a real-world component of the Sea't-Shell. The sensors, motors, and suspension system were selected for precision and responsiveness, with the model designed to support future upgrades or adaptations, including enhanced AI processing for complex motion detection. By capturing the interaction between components in the model, I ensured that the Sea't-Shell could be visualized as a practical and adaptable system that meets user needs effectively. This approach allowed for consistent alignment between the conceptual model and potential real-world applications, emphasizing a systematic, flexible methodology essential for creating innovative stabilization solutions.The model achieves stabilization by integrating sensors, responsive motors, and a robust suspension system, all controlled by a central microcontroller. By continuously monitoring and counteracting wave-induced movements, the Sea't-Shell maintains a steady position relative to the vessel, allowing users to focus on tasks or relax comfortably without the usual physical strain caused by sea motion.
